# Adding newsletter signup to website sections (2025-09-03 15:55Z)

_**User (2025-09-03 15:56Z)**_

Can you add a subscribe to newsletter link to:

Homepage Bottom CTA Section (Very Effective)
I notice you have a "What's Next" section on your homepage - this would be perfect for a newsletter signup.

Footer (Always Visible)
Add it to a footer component that appears on every page.

Calendar Page

Here's the link
https://techtalkaugusta.beehiiv.com/

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add the newsletter subscription link to those three locations. Let me first examine the current structure of these pages to understand how to best integrate the newsletter signup. Now let me check the Footer component: Now let me check the Calendar page: Let me see the complete "What's Next" section to understand its full structure: Let me check the end of the calendar page: Now let me check if there's more content in the footer that I need to see: Perfect! Now I have a good understanding of the current structure. Let me add the newsletter subscription link to all three locations:

## 1. First, let's add the newsletter signup to the "What's Next" section on the homepage 
```

```
## 2. Now let's add the newsletter link to the Footer component 
```

```
## 3. Now let's add the newsletter signup to the Calendar page

I'll add it as a call-to-action section at the end of the calendar page: Let me find where the main content ends in the calendar page so I can add the newsletter section: I see there's already a newsletter section in the calendar page! Let me update it to use the correct Beehiiv link: 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully added the newsletter subscription link to all three requested locations:

## Summary of Changes

### 1. **Homepage "What's Next" Section**
- Added a third card in the "What's Next" section with:
  - ðŸ“§ icon

### 2. **Footer Component**

### 3. **Calendar Page**

- Changed from `/forms/newsletter` to `https://techtalkaugusta.beehiiv.com/`
- Added proper external link attributes

All links now point to your Beehiiv newsletter at `https://techtalkaugusta.beehiiv.com/` and open in new tabs for external links. The newsletter subscription is now prominently featured in high-visibility areas across your site:

- **Homepage**: In the engaging "What's Next" CTA section

The implementations maintain consistency with your existing design system and button styles.
