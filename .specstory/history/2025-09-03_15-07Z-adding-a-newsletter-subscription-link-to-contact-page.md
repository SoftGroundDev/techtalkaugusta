# Adding a newsletter subscription link to contact page (2025-09-03 15:07Z)

_**User (2025-09-03 15:08Z)**_

How would you add a link to the techtalk website for subscribing to our newsletter?

---

_**Assistant**_

I can help you add a newsletter subscription link to your contact page. Looking at your current contact page structure, I can see you have a "contact-methods" section that would be perfect for adding a newsletter subscription option.

Let me first check if there are any existing newsletter-related components or pages in your workspace to understand your current setup. Great! I can see that you already have a newsletter subscription system in place. Looking at the calendar page, I found that you already have a newsletter link at `/forms/newsletter`. Now let me check your forms configuration to see what newsletter forms you have set up. Now I understand! I can see that you don't currently have a newsletter form in your forms configuration, but there's already a link to `/forms/newsletter` in your calendar page. Let me add a newsletter subscription option to your contact page and show you how to set up the newsletter form.

Here's how to add a newsletter subscription link to your contact page:

````svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import transparentLogo from '$lib/images/logo-transparent.png';
</script>

<svelte:head>
	<title>Contact - Tech Talk Augusta</title>
	<meta

		content="Get in touch with Tech Talk Augusta. We'd love to hear from you about events, partnerships, or any questions you may have."
	/>
	<meta

		content="Contact Us, Tech Talk Augusta, Get in Touch, Augusta Tech Community"
	/>
	<meta property="og:title" content="Contact - Tech Talk Augusta" />

You'll also need to add a newsletter form to your forms configuration. Add this to your `forms.ts` file:

````typescript
export const googleForms: GoogleForm[] = [
	{
		id: 'newsletter',
		title: 'Newsletter Subscription',
		description: 'Subscribe to receive updates about upcoming events and community news.',
		googleFormUrl: 'YOUR_NEWSLETTER_GOOGLE_FORM_URL_HERE',
		category: 'Community',
		active: true
	},
	{
		id: 'business-projects',
		title: 'Business Project Intake',
		description: 'As a business owner, you can submit projects you\'d like the community to work on.',
		googleFormUrl: 'https://forms.gle/HyWPtjjSP5Cdqpg38',
		category: 'projects',
		active: true
	},
	{
		id: 'talent-pool',
		title: 'Join the Talent Roster',
		description: 'Join the talent roster to be notified of projects and opportunities.',
		googleFormUrl: 'https://forms.gle/sZcLuEMpvvD962TS7',
		category: 'projects',
		active: true
	}
];
````

This solution:

1. **Adds a Newsletter section** to your contact methods at the top of the list to give it prominence
2. **Uses consistent styling** with your existing contact methods
3. **Links to `/forms/newsletter`** which matches the existing pattern used in your `calendar page`
4. **Provides clear messaging** about what subscribers can expect

To complete the setup, you'll need to:
1. Create a Google Form for newsletter signups
2. Replace `YOUR_NEWSLETTER_GOOGLE_FORM_URL_HERE` with your actual Google Form URL
3. The form will automatically be available at `/forms/newsletter` once added to the configuration

The newsletter option is now prominently placed as the first contact method, making it easy for visitors to subscribe to stay updated with your community!

It won't be a form itself. It's a link to the beehiiv website where they will manage the subscription process

_**Assistant**_

Perfect! That makes it much simpler. You'll be linking directly to your Beehiiv newsletter subscription page instead of using a form. Here's how to add the newsletter subscription link to your contact page:

````svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import transparentLogo from '$lib/images/logo-transparent.png';
</script>

	/>
	<meta
		name="keywords"
		content="Contact Us, Tech Talk Augusta, Get in Touch, Augusta Tech Community"
	/>
	<meta property="og:title" content="Contact - Tech Talk Augusta" />
	<meta
		property="og:description"
		content="Get in touch with Tech Talk Augusta. We'd love to hear from you about events, partnerships, or any questions you may have."

This adds:

1. **Newsletter section** as the first contact method for maximum visibility
2. **Direct link to Beehiiv** with `target="_blank"` to open in a new tab
3. **Proper accessibility** attributes (`rel="noopener noreferrer"`)
4. **Consistent styling** with your existing contact methods
5. **Clear messaging** about what subscribers will receive

Simply replace `YOUR_BEEHIIV_NEWSLETTER_URL` with your actual Beehiiv newsletter subscription URL. The newsletter subscription will now be prominently featured at the top of your contact methods, making it easy for visitors to subscribe directly through Beehiiv's platform.

Is Contact Page the best place to put it?

_**Assistant**_

Good question! Let me analyze where newsletter subscriptions are typically most effective and check your current site structure to give you the best recommendation. Now let me check your homepage to see the current layout better: Perfect! After analyzing your site structure and best practices for newsletter placement, here's my recommendation:

**The Contact page is actually NOT the best place for a newsletter subscription.** Here are better options ranked by effectiveness:

## 🏆 **Best Places to Add Newsletter Subscription:**

### 1. **Homepage Hero Section** (Most Effective)
Add it right in your main hero section alongside "View Upcoming Events" - this gets the highest visibility.

### 2. **Homepage
