# Strategic Dialogue: 2026 Vision & Growth Strategy

**Purpose:** High-level strategic conversation about Tech Talk Augusta's future direction

**Context:** You want to give a presentation about 2026 plans including hackathons, a conference, maintaining monthly meetups, and building projects that create community impact with an AI agent to guide growth.

---

## Current Strategic Position

From OVERVIEW.md, Tech Talk Augusta has:
- ✅ Established monthly meetup cadence
- ✅ Multi-platform presence (web, Discord, Eventbrite, Meetup, Facebook)
- ✅ Cross-platform event synchronization built
- ✅ Clear mission: innovation, connection, equity
- ✅ Vision: bridge gap between Augusta's world-class institutions and local entrepreneurs

**Strategic Tension:**
You're at an inflection point - evolved beyond "just a meetup" but not yet a full ecosystem player.

## The Strategic Question

**You said:** "I want projects that impact the community. I want to build an Agent that helps guide us in that direction and build a growth plan."

This tells me you're thinking about:
1. **Impact** > just events
2. **Guidance/Direction** > feeling your way forward
3. **Growth** > intentional scaling

**My Strategic Read:**
You're trying to evolve from community organizer to ecosystem builder. That's a different game with different challenges.

Is that the right frame? Yes

## Strategic Themes to Explore

### Theme 1: Impact Definition
What does "community impact" mean strategically? Direct Service to start off with. If we get god at solutioning for Augusta we can build relationships and trust in the community. I'd rather solve problems for folks. I feel like the other things come with more scale.

Some frameworks:
- **Direct Service:** Build tools/solutions for specific Augusta problems
- **Capacity Building:** Empower others to build solutions
- **Economic Development:** Create jobs, startups, economic activity
- **Social Equity:** Reduce barriers, increase access, address inequality
- **Ecosystem Development:** Build the infrastructure for sustained innovation

Which resonates? Are you trying to do all of them? I do want to do all of them eventually. But do need to focus

**Strategic Implication:** Different impact models require different resources, partners, and measures of success.

---

### Theme 2: The Agent as Strategic Tool
You want an agent to "guide us in that direction and build a growth plan."

Strategic question: **What decision-making are you trying to augment?** I want an agent that can do all of that. I'd like this organization led by an AI Agent. I have a software company that would like to sell AI Agents to companies. I'd like this one to be a shining example.

Possibilities:
- **Pattern Recognition:** "What's working that we should double down on?"
- **Opportunity Identification:** "What problems should we tackle next?"
- **Resource Allocation:** "Where should we invest time/money/energy?"
- **Relationship Mapping:** "Who should we connect with/partner with?"
- **Growth Strategy:** "How do we scale without losing our soul?"

**Strategic Implication:** The agent isn't just automation - it's a strategic intelligence layer for community building. 

---

### Theme 3: Hackathons as Strategic Bet
4 hackathons in a year is significant investment of energy. I agree and I'm not certain if they're the right vehicle. This was something that I came up with randomly. This AI Agent that we're creating should generate the growth plans moving forward.

Strategic questions:
- Are hackathons the **right vehicle** for community impact in Augusta? 
- What makes a hackathon different from just "coding competition"? 
- How do you ensure outcomes actually get deployed/used?
- What's your theory of change: hackathons → ???  → community impact

**Strategic Implication:** Hackathons could be brilliant or could be a drain depending on how they connect to your broader strategy.

---

### Theme 4: Conference as Strategic Signal
One conference says: "We're serious. We're here. Pay attention."

Strategic questions:
- Who are you signaling to? (Augusta? Southeast? Cyber community? Investors? Students?) Augusta
- What position are you trying to claim? (Tech hub? Cyber hub? Innovation hub?) Technologists who care about their community (so tech hub?)
- Is this about **attraction** (bring outsiders in) or **cohesion** (rally locals)? Cohesion
- How does this advance your mission beyond "we had a big event"? If we can get folks encouraged to solve local problems, and to want to build tech for the community and get rewarded for it and see others get rewarded for it. It would be a huge win.

**Strategic Implication:** A conference is expensive and risky. It needs to be strategically justified beyond "it would be cool." I like how you're thinking

---

### Theme 5: Presentation as Strategic Moment
You're presenting to "the board" but "the board is my community."

This is interesting. You're treating your community as stakeholders/governors, not just attendees.

Strategic questions:
- What decision do you need from them? I need to know what would excite them. This could just be because I'm not finding traction in what I'm currently doing and so am asking them to tell me.
- Are you seeking **permission**, **commitment**, **resources**, or **buy-in**? buy-in
- What's the social contract you're proposing? I don't know
- How much voice do they get in shaping this vs. you're presenting a plan? I'd like them to help. I'd rather just work on my company. But I feel like if I can't 

**Strategic Implication:** This framing positions you as accountable to the community. That's powerful but also constraining.

## Strategic Dialogue Points

I'd like to explore with you:

### 1. Theory of Change
**If 2026 is successful, what changed in Augusta?**

Not activities (we did hackathons), but outcomes:
- X number of students got into tech careers?
- Y solutions deployed that help Z people?
- Augusta recognized as _____ in the tech world?
- Local tech talent stopped leaving for Atlanta?

What's the change you're trying to create?

---

### 2. Sustainable Advantage
**What can Tech Talk Augusta do that others can't?**

You're competing for:
- People's time (vs. other meetups, online communities)
- Sponsor dollars (vs. other causes)
- Partner attention (vs. other initiatives)

What's your unfair advantage? Local authenticity? Cross-platform tech? Community trust? Something else?

---

### 3. Resource Reality
**What's the constraint you're optimizing around?**

Every strategy has constraints:
- Money (can't afford big ambitions)
- Time/Volunteers (can't execute big ambitions)
- Attention (community is maxed out)
- Legitimacy (can't get institutional partners to take you seriously)

Which constraint most shapes your strategy?

---

### 4. Agent Strategy
**Is the agent a tool or a product?**

Two very different strategic paths:
- **Tool:** Build it to solve YOUR problems (community management, growth planning)
- **Product:** Build it as a platform others could use (revenue, impact scale)

Which are you thinking?

---

### 5. Presentation Strategy
**What do you need this presentation to accomplish?**

Possible goals:
- **Alignment:** Get everyone on the same page about direction
- **Commitment:** Lock in volunteers, sponsors, partners for 2026
- **Feedback:** Test the strategy before you're too far down the path
- **Permission:** Get community blessing to pursue this vision
- **Inspiration:** Rally people around something bigger

What's the primary goal?

---

## How I Can Help Strategically

Once I understand your strategic thinking, I can:

1. **Stress-test the strategy:** Play devil's advocate, identify risks
2. **Develop strategic options:** "Here are 3 different ways to approach this"
3. **Create strategic narratives:** Frame the story in a way that moves people
4. **Design decision frameworks:** Help you make choices aligned with strategy
5. **Build strategic artifacts:** Presentations, plans, etc. that serve the strategy

But I need to understand the strategy first, not just the tactics.

---

## Next: Your Strategic Thinking

What I'd find most helpful:

**Tell me about the change you're trying to create in Augusta.**

Not the activities, but the actual change. If Tech Talk Augusta wildly succeeds over the next 2-3 years, what's different in Augusta?

From there, we can work backwards to what 2026 needs to be.
